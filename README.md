## Artificial Intelligence

### Open Source Tools
- [open-llms](https://github.com/gth-ai/open-llms): These LLMs (Large Language Models) are all licensed for commercial use (e.g., Apache 2.0, MIT, OpenRAIL-M). Contributions welcome!
- [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp): The main goal of `llama.cpp` is to enable LLM inference with minimal setup and state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of hardware - locally and in the cloud.
- [xplique](https://github.com/deel-ai/xplique): ðŸ¦Š **Xplique** (pronounced *\É›ks.plik\*) is a Python toolkit dedicated to explainability. The goal of this library is to gather the state of the art of Explainable AI to help you understand your complex neural network models. Originally built for Tensorflow's model it also works for PyTorch models partially.
- [OpenMMLab](https://github.com/open-mmlab): OpenMMLab builds the most influential open-source computer vision algorithm system in the deep learning era.
- [Perplexica](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica): A open-source version of Perplexity : Perplexica is an open-source AI-powered searching tool or an AI-powered search engine that goes deep into the internet to find answers. Inspired by Perplexity AI, it's an open-source option that not just searches the web but understands your questions. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms like similarity searching and embeddings to refine results and provides clear answers with sources cited.

### Free Courses and Resources
- [ML-YouTube-Courses](https://github.com/gth-ai/ML-YouTube-Courses): A collection of Machine Learning courses available on YouTube.
- [Prompt-Engineering-Guide](https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide): Prompt Engineering Guide. Prompt engineering is a relatively new discipline for developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use language models (LMs) for a wide variety of applications and research topics.
- [deep-learning-with-python-notebooks](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks): Companion Jupyter notebooks for the book "Deep Learning with Python". This repository contains Jupyter notebooks implementing the code samples found in the book Deep Learning with Python, 2nd Edition (Manning Publications).

### Research and Papers
- [ML-Papers-of-the-Week](https://github.com/dair-ai/ML-Papers-of-the-Week): A weekly list of top ML papers in your inbox.
- [SyntheX](https://github.com/arcadelab/SyntheX): This repository contains the training and testing scripts on the three SyntheX applications, namely hip imaging, surgical tool detection and covid. The associated data is provided in a separate folder. Detailed running instructions can be found in each sub folder.
- [awesome-object-detection](https://github.com/gth-ai/awesome-object-detection): This is a list of awesome articles about object detection.
- [Awesome Computer Vision](https://github.com/jbhuang0604/awesome-computer-vision): A curated list of awesome computer vision resources.
  
#### Tools 
- [Medecine](https://github.com/primakov/precision-medicine-toolbox): precision-medicine-toolbox is an open-source python package for medical imaging data preparation for data science tasks. This package is aimed to provide a tool to curate the imaging data and to perform exploratory feature analysis.
- [LanguageTool](https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool): An Open Source proofreading software for English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Polish, Dutch, and more than 20 other languages. It finds many errors that a simple spell checker cannot detect.
- [Online LaTeX diff tool](https://3142.nl/latex-diff/): An online free tool is a wrapper script for latexdiff, which is the LaTeX alternative to Track Changes in Microsoft Word. By using this tool you avoid the command line and having to install Perl. We do not keep copies of your documents.
- [doi2bib](https://www.doi2bib.org/):Give us a DOI
- [Nexus](https://libstc.cc/#/):Help you to found any recent paper.

#### Database
- [UC Irvine Machine Learning](https://archive.ics.uci.edu): Currently maintain 665 datasets as a service to the machine learning community.
- [paperswithcode](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets): Contains various Dataset with code and scientifs papers.
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets): Various datasets hosted by Kaggle.

### ChatGPT Implementations
- [Awesome ChatGPT](https://github.com/stars/acheong08/lists/awesome-chatgpt): Awesome ChatGPT implementations.

## Dev
### Open Source Tools
- [Awesome Dev Tools](https://github.com/markodenic/web-development-resources): Awesome project about Web Development resources.
- [OpenDevin](https://github.com/OpenDevin/OpenDevin):A platform for autonomous software engineers, powered by AI and LLMs. OpenDevin agents collaborate with human developers to write code, fix bugs, and ship features.
