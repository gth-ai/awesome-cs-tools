## Artificial Intelligence

### Open Source Tools
- [open-llms](https://github.com/gth-ai/open-llms): These LLMs (Large Language Models) are all licensed for commercial use (e.g., Apache 2.0, MIT, OpenRAIL-M). Contributions welcome!
- [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp): The main goal of `llama.cpp` is to enable LLM inference with minimal setup and state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of hardware - locally and in the cloud.
- [xplique](https://github.com/deel-ai/xplique): ðŸ¦Š **Xplique** (pronounced *\É›ks.plik\*) is a Python toolkit dedicated to explainability. The goal of this library is to gather the state of the art of Explainable AI to help you understand your complex neural network models. Originally built for Tensorflow's model it also works for PyTorch models partially.

### Free Courses and Resources
- [ML-YouTube-Courses](https://github.com/gth-ai/ML-YouTube-Courses): A collection of Machine Learning courses available on YouTube.
- [Prompt-Engineering-Guide](https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide): Prompt Engineering Guide. Prompt engineering is a relatively new discipline for developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use language models (LMs) for a wide variety of applications and research topics.
- [deep-learning-with-python-notebooks](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks): Companion Jupyter notebooks for the book "Deep Learning with Python". This repository contains Jupyter notebooks implementing the code samples found in the book Deep Learning with Python, 2nd Edition (Manning Publications).

### Research and Papers
- [ML-Papers-of-the-Week](https://github.com/dair-ai/ML-Papers-of-the-Week): A weekly list of top ML papers in your inbox.
- [SyntheX](https://github.com/arcadelab/SyntheX): This repository contains the training and testing scripts on the three SyntheX applications, namely hip imaging, surgical tool detection and covid. The associated data is provided in a separate folder. Detailed running instructions can be found in each sub folder.
- [awesome-object-detection](https://github.com/gth-ai/awesome-object-detection): This is a list of awesome articles about object detection.

### ChatGPT Implementations
- [Awesome ChatGPT](https://github.com/stars/acheong08/lists/awesome-chatgpt): Awesome ChatGPT implementations.

## Dev

- [Awesome Dev Tools](https://github.com/markodenic/web-development-resources): Awesome project about Web Development resources.

## Security

### Open Source Tools
- [awesome-opensource-security](https://github.com/gth-ai/awesome-opensource-security): A list of interesting open-source security tools, mostly reviewed and commented by me. The repo updates on a daily basis or whenever something interesting is out.
